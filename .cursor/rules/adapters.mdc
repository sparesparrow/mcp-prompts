- Follow adapter pattern strictly

## Testing Strategy
- Integration tests with real dependencies
- Mock external services when needed
- Test error handling extensively
- Performance tests for critical paths

## Build Configuration
- Own tsconfig.json extending root options
- Build outputs to dist/
- Include type declarations
