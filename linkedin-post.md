🚀 Excited to share my latest project: **MCP Prompts v3.10.0** - A comprehensive Model Context Protocol server deployed on AWS! 🚀

## What I Built

I've created a full-featured MCP server that enables AI assistants (like Cursor) to manage and apply reusable prompts through a clean API. The system is now live on AWS with:

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights
- **Serverless Stack**: Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, SQS
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with ports & adapters
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous processing with SQS for scalability
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and error handling

### ✨ Key Features
- 18+ curated prompts for development tasks (code review, debugging, documentation, etc.)
- RESTful API with proper authentication and validation
- CLI tool for easy prompt management
- Seamless Cursor IDE integration
- CloudWatch dashboards and automated alerting

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- TypeScript/Node.js
- AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- PNPM for package management
- Pino for structured logging
