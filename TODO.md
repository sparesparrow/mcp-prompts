# MCP Prompts: Multi-Repository Migration & Roadmap

This document serves as the master plan for the strategic migration of the MCP Prompts server from a monorepo to a federated, multi-repository ecosystem. It synthesizes the project's strategic analysis, architectural designs, and phased implementation plans into a single, actionable roadmap.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Vision & Principles

- **Goal:** Evolve from a monolithic product into a modular, platform-centric ecosystem that serves as a reference implementation for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Core Principle:** Separate concerns by decoupling data (prompts), contracts (API definitions), and implementations (language-specific servers).
- **Architecture:** A federated model with a central meta-repository for orchestration, a versioned repository for the prompt collection, a language-agnostic repository for API contracts, and independent repositories for each implementation (TypeScript, Rust, PostgreSQL, Android).

## migration-plan: Migration Plan

### Phase 0: Pre-Migration & Stabilization

**Objective:** Complete core features, fix all critical bugs, stabilize the current monorepo, and prepare for a safe extraction process. These tasks must be completed _before_ starting the repository split.

#### 1. Core Feature Completion (High Priority)

##### Enhanced File Adapter (Storage)

- [x] **Schema Validation (High):** Strictly validate all JSON files on read/write to prevent data corruption.
- [ ] **Concurrency Control (High):** Implement file locking to prevent race conditions during write operations.
- [ ] **Indexing (Medium):** Create a metadata index file to speed up list operations for large prompt collections.
- [ ] **Atomic Writes (Low):** Use a "write-then-rename" pattern for safe, atomic updates.

##### Advanced Templating Engine

- [ ] **Conditional Logic (High):** Support `if/else` constructs within templates for dynamic content generation.
- [x] **Loops (Medium):** Support iteration over arrays (`#each`) to dynamically generate content.
- [ ] **Nested Templates / Partials (Medium):** Allow templates to include other templates to promote reuse.
- [ ] **Configurable Delimiters (Low):** Allow users to specify variable delimiters (e.g., `{{var}}`, `${var}`).
- [ ] **Variable Extraction (Low):** Implement a server-side function to automatically extract all variables from a template.
- [ ] **Helper Functions (Low):** Create a library of built-in helper functions (e.g., `toUpperCase`, `formatDate`).

#### 2. Bug Fixes & Stabilization

- [x] **Fix HTTP Server Integration tests** (`tests/integration/http-server.integration.test.ts`)
- [x] **Fix WorkflowService (Stateful) unit tests** (`tests/unit/workflow-service.unit.test.ts`)
- [ ] **Fix HTTP Server error handling unit tests** (`src/__tests__/http-server.test.ts`)
- [x] **Fix Validation unit tests** (`tests/unit/validation.unit.test.ts`)
- [x] **Fix FileAdapter integration tests** (`tests/integration/file-adapter.integration.test.ts`)
- [ ] **Fix PromptService template helpers unit tests** (`tests/unit/prompt-service.unit.test.ts`) - **BLOCKED**: The `edit_file` tool is unable to correct a simple import error in the test file, preventing tests from running.

#### 3. Migration Preparation

- [x] **Simulate Repository Structure:** Create local directories to mirror the target multi-repo architecture before performing the full migration.
  - [x] Create directories: `mcp-prompts-ts`, `mcp-prompts-rs`, `mcp-prompts-aidl`, `mcp-prompts-collection`, `mcp-prompts-py`, `mcp-prompts-contracts`.
  - [x] Add placeholder `README.md` files to each directory to define its purpose.
- [ ] **Security audit and cleanup:** Run `npm audit fix --force` and `cargo audit` and remove any secrets from git history.
- [ ] **Prepare extraction scripts:**
  - [ ] Create `scripts/extract-collection.sh` for prompt data.
  - [ ] Create `scripts/extract-contracts.sh` for type definitions.
  - [ ] Create `scripts/extract-implementations.sh` for each language.
  - [ ] Add verification scripts to ensure history is preserved using `git-filter-repo`.
- [ ] **Create final monorepo tag and documentation:**
  - [ ] Add tag `monorepo-final-v1.8.0` with comprehensive release notes.
  - [ ] Update `README.md` with a migration notice and links to the new meta-repository.
  - [ ] Create `MIGRATION.md` explaining the transition in detail.
