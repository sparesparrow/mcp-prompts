# MCP Prompts Server - Completed Consolidation Plan

This document outlines the completed work on the simplified architecture refactoring and further steps for improvement.

## ✅ Completed Simplification (v1.3.0)

### Core Architecture Simplification

✅ Implemented simplified architecture following SOLID principles
✅ Created unified core types in a single file (`src/core/types.ts`)
✅ Implemented focused storage adapters with file-based storage (`src/adapters/file-adapter.ts`)
✅ Created streamlined prompt service (`src/services/prompt-service.ts`)
✅ Simplified configuration management (`src/config.ts`)
✅ Streamlined MCP server implementation with tools (`src/index.ts`)
✅ Removed complex CLI interface in favor of focused MCP tools
✅ Removed unnecessary utilities and functions
✅ Created Docker and Docker Compose configurations for easy deployment

### Developer Experience Improvements

✅ Improved error handling with proper TypeScript types
✅ Simplified file structure with clear separation of concerns
✅ Made extension and maintenance easier with clean interfaces
✅ Reduced codebase complexity and file count significantly
✅ Updated documentation to reflect new architecture

## Next Steps for Improvement

### Phase 1: Testing

- [ ] Add comprehensive Jest tests for all components
- [ ] Add integration tests for the MCP tools
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Additional Adapters

- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL storage adapter
- [ ] Implement in-memory storage adapter
- [ ] Add adapter selection based on configuration

### Phase 3: Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces and classes
- [ ] Create API documentation with TypeDoc
- [ ] Add more examples in documentation

### Phase 4: CI/CD

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- [ ] Add automated testing on pull requests
- [ ] Set up automatic versioning and releases

## Benefits of Simplification

- **Reduced File Count**: Dramatically fewer files to navigate and maintain
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Clean, focused codebase is easier to understand
- **Better TypeScript Integration**: Consistent typing throughout the codebase
- **SOLID Architecture**: Code follows best practices for maintainability
- **Easier Extension**: New adapters and features can be added without changing existing code
- **Docker Integration**: Easy deployment with Docker and integration with other MCP servers
- **Simplified Configuration**: Streamlined environment variable handling

## Maintenance Guidelines

For ongoing maintenance, follow these steps:

1. **Follow SOLID Principles**
   - Keep single responsibility for classes
   - Extend through interfaces rather than modifying existing code
   - Use dependency injection

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Keep README.md up to date with any changes
   - Update CHANGELOG.md for each release

3. **Write Tests**
   - Add tests for all new features
   - Maintain high test coverage

4. **Clean Code**
   - Use consistent naming
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Use interfaces for type definitions
   - Add proper error handling
