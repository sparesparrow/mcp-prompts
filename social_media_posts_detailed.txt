🏗️ The Day AI Agents Rewrote Our Architecture: A 6,076 Line Commit Story

We built MCP Prompts to solve "prompt chaos" - teams losing track of AI prompt versions.

Then our AI agents created REPOSITORY CHAOS with commit 9a739da:
• 127 files changed in one commit
• +6,076 lines, -17,785 lines 
• Complete monorepo restructure with hexagonal architecture

Every decision seemed logical:
✅ "Separate file adapters from memory adapters"
✅ "Create dedicated packages for CLI/REST/Postgres" 
✅ "Implement proper dependency injection"

But commit 10674e5 told a different story:
❌ Circular dependencies everywhere
❌ Build order nightmares: core → adapters → apps
❌ Import paths: @core/* became @mcp-prompts/core/dist/*

The irony? We built a server to manage prompt chaos... and created architectural chaos.

Key lesson: AI agents are brilliant at following patterns, terrible at knowing when to stop.

Now we're teaching our agents: "Before creating complexity, ask WHY."

💡 When AI Agents Go Full Microservices: The MCP Prompts Saga

Our commit history tells a story every developer will recognize:

📊 Commit 9a739da: "The Great Genesis"
• AI agents create perfect monorepo structure
• 127 files, TypeScript everywhere, hexagonal architecture
• Everything organized, everything has its place

🔄 Commit 10674e5: "The Build Labyrinth" 
• Fix circular dependencies
• Update ALL imports to built outputs
• Add build order requirements

🚀 Commit 0e55734: "The Modernization"
• Atomic file writes with proper-lockfile
• Zod validation for everything
• ESLint 9, SWC build system

🎯 Commit 8d2a84c: "Return to Simplicity"
• Scripts for consolidation
• Streamlined installation
• Finally asking: "Do we need all this?"

The lesson: Smart AI ≠ Wise AI

Sometimes the best architecture is the one that doesn't try to solve every problem.

Building better prompts for AI agents who understand restraint.

🤖 The Recursive Problem: When AI Fixes AI Mistakes by Creating More AI Problems

Real story from our MCP Prompts development:

Problem: "We need better prompt organization"
AI Solution: Create 6 separate repositories

Each seemed logical:
• mcp-prompts-catalog (data storage)
• mcp-prompts-contracts (shared types)  
• mcp-prompts-ts (core implementation)
• mcp-prompts-rs (performance layer)
• cursor-rules (dev experience)

Result: Repository management became harder than prompt management.

The beautiful irony? Our solution to "prompt chaos" created "architectural chaos."

Now we face the ultimate 2025 challenge: How do you build AI agents that know when NOT to optimize?

We're working on prompts that include:
✅ "Before creating a new component, ask why"
✅ "Default to keeping things together"  
✅ "When in doubt, choose simplicity"

Because the future belongs to AI that knows its limits.

⚡ The $1 Million Question: How Much Complexity Can AI Create?

Our MCP Prompts journey in numbers:
• Started with: 1 focused repository  
• AI agents created: 6 separate repositories
• Build complexity: Circular dependencies requiring specific build order
• Import statements: @core/* → @mcp-prompts/core/dist/* 
• Result: The exact chaos we set out to prevent

But here's what we learned building enterprise prompt management:

✅ AI agents excel at pattern recognition
❌ AI agents struggle with pattern restraint  
✅ Perfect organization can create imperfect workflows
❌ More repositories ≠ better architecture

The real value? Understanding how to guide AI decision-making.

Our customers now get:
• Centralized prompt versioning (the original goal)
• Lessons in AI agent management 
• A cautionary tale that saves them months of complexity

Sometimes the best product is the one that learns from its own mistakes.

💡 Our AI agents read "microservices best practices" 

Result: 1 repo → 6 repos → build complexity hell

The irony: We built MCP Prompts to solve "prompt chaos"

AI agents created "repository chaos" instead

🤖 AI Agent Logic:
1. See pattern: "separation of concerns"  
2. Apply everywhere
3. Create 6 repositories
4. Require specific build order: core → adapters → apps
5. Break all imports

Us: "Maybe... one repo was fine?"

📊 MCP Prompts Evolution Timeline:

Day 1: Simple prompt server ✅
Day 30: Hexagonal architecture ✅  
Day 60: 6 separate repositories ❓
Day 90: Build order requirements ❌
Day 120: "Maybe one repo was better?" 💭

Moral: AI agents need wisdom, not just patterns
