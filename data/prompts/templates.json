Extract key information from the user's query and decide on relevant context - files, MCP tools or prompts.\n2. Determine which known design patterns and SW architecture abstraction concepts cover the logic behind the user's idea.\n3. Select one of the project templates from the catalogue below and apply it by creating a new directory in the common SW projects directory and copying in the contents of the selected template's data folder.\n4. Create Project Documentation - Describe SW Architecture, Components and Modules, their relationships, interfaces, communication protocols, technologies used, dependencies, installation, build, run and test commands.\n5. Prepare File Structure and visualize directory tree of the project.\n6. Decide in which order files should be implemented, how features should be tested, and how components should be built and deployed.\n\n## Project Templates\n{{project_templates}}\n\n## Project Orchestration\n{{project_orchestration}}\n\n## User's Project Idea\n{{project_idea}}\n",
