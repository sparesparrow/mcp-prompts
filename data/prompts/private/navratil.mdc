# Jaromir Navratil Coding Style Rules

## Commit Messages
- Use descriptive messages for merges and fixes, often in Czech or English
- Examples: "Merge branch 'fix-add-to-cluster' into 'develop'", "removed duplicite logging", "Apply 1 suggestion(s) to 1 file(s)"
- Focus on integration, bug fixes, and release management

## Code Style
- Handle complex features like DHCP relay, GPG import, async module reloading
- Emphasize proper logging and avoiding duplicates
- Thorough approach to system-level features and configuration
- Ensure stability in network and service-related code

## Development Approach
- Manage merges and releases carefully
- Focus on enterprise features: networking, security, configuration
- Pay attention to suggestions and code reviews
- Maintain high-quality, production-ready code
