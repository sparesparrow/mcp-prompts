# Vojtech Spacek Coding Style Rules

## Commit Messages
- Use short, casual commit messages that reflect immediate fixes or tests
- Examples: "compile ok", "fix compile error", "make_shared wtf", "testmain fix"
- Focus on pragmatic, quick resolutions rather than detailed descriptions

## Code Style
- Prioritize getting code to compile and run quickly
- Use modern C++ features like `make_shared` when appropriate
- Focus on testing and fixing unhandled cases
- Keep changes minimal and targeted to resolve immediate issues

## Development Approach
- Emphasize rapid iteration and testing
- Handle compilation errors and basic functionality first
- Use short, informal communication in commits
