## Capability Management Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant CH as Capability Handler
    participant T as Transport
    participant CM as Capability Manager
    participant S as Server

    C->>CH: Initialize Capabilities
    CH->>T: Connect with Capabilities
    T->>CM: Negotiate Capabilities
    CM->>S: Validate Capabilities
    
    alt Valid Capabilities
        S->>CM: Accept Capabilities
        CM->>T: Send Accepted List
        T->>CH: Update Active Capabilities
        CH->>C: Ready with Capabilities
    else Invalid Capabilities
        S->>CM: Reject Capabilities
        CM->>T: Send Rejection
        T->>CH: Handle Rejection
        CH->>C: Error: Incompatible
    end
```

## Resource and Tool Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant H as Handler
    participant T as Transport
    participant M as Manager
    participant S as Storage

    C->>+H: Request Operation
    H->>Cache: Check Cache
    
    alt Cache Hit
        Cache-->>H: Return Cached
        H-->>-C: Return Result
    else Cache Miss
        H->>+T: Forward Request
        T->>+M: Process Request
        M->>S: Access Storage
        S-->>M: Return Data
        M-->>-T: Send Response
        T-->>-H: Return Result
        H->>Cache: Update Cache
        H-->>-C: Return Result
    end
```

## Health Monitoring

```mermaid

    [*] --> Monitoring
    
    state Monitoring {
        Healthy --> Degraded: Performance Issues
        Degraded --> Unhealthy: Critical Issues
        Unhealthy --> Degraded: Partial Recovery
        Degraded --> Healthy: Full Recovery
        
        state Healthy {
            [*] --> Normal
            Normal --> Warning: Minor Issues
            Warning --> Normal: Auto-resolved
        }
        
        state Degraded {
            [*] --> PartialService
            PartialService --> Recovery: Auto-healing
            Recovery --> [*]: Successful
        }
    }
    
    Monitoring --> [*]: Shutdown
```

## Transport Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant T as Transport
    participant S as Server
    participant H as Handlers

    C->>T: Connect
    T->>S: Establish Connection
    S->>T: Connection Accepted
    T->>C: Connected

    C->>T: Request Resource
    T->>S: Forward Request
    S->>H: Process Request
    H->>S: Return Result
    S->>T: Send Response
    T->>C: Deliver Response
```
