## Progress Update

### Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created minimal versions of the shared package that successfully compile
2. ✅ Created minimal versions of the backend package that successfully compile
3. ✅ Updated package.json scripts to build the minimal versions
4. ✅ Updated the README.md with current status and known issues

### Current Status

The project is now in a transitional state where:

- We have minimal versions of the shared and backend packages that compile successfully
- These minimal versions provide the core types and functionality needed
- The original code is still present but has import path issues
- The frontend package still needs a minimal version

### Next Steps

1. Create a minimal version of the frontend package
2. Update the main package.json to build all minimal versions
3. Incrementally fix import paths in the original code
4. Gradually transition from minimal versions back to the full codebase

### How to Work with the Current Codebase

During this transition period, you can:

1. Use the minimal versions for development and testing
2. Run `npm run build` to build the minimal versions
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development servers
4. When working on specific files, update their import paths to match the new structure

### Remaining Issues

- Import paths in the original code still reference the old structure
- Some type definitions may be incomplete in the minimal versions
- The frontend package needs to be updated to work with the new structure
