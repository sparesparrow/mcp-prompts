# MCP Improved Prompts - Project Status

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Created improved prompts for various categories:
  - Development prompts (code review, refactoring, debugging)
  - Architecture/Design prompts (system architecture)
  - Analysis prompts (data analysis, content analysis)
  - Research prompts (research assistant, topic modeling)
  - Language/Translation prompts (contextual translation)
  - Planning prompts (strategic foresight)
  - Productivity prompts (question generation, follow-up questions)

- [x] Developed migration script (`scripts/migrate-prompts.ts`) for improved prompts
- [x] Created verification script (`scripts/verify-improved-prompts.ts`) to validate migration
- [x] Added new npm scripts in package.json for improved prompts:
  - `pgai:migrate:improved` - Migrate improved prompts to PGAI database
  - `pgai:migrate:improved:dry` - Dry run migration for testing
  - `pgai:verify` - Verify improved prompts in PGAI database
- [x] Created PGAI configuration template (`config/pgai.json`)
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation:
  - PostgreSQL/PGAI setup guide (`docs/pgai-setup.md`)
  - Implementation plan (`docs/implementation-plan.md`)
  - Updated README with improved prompts information
- [x] Made all scripts executable

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Test end-to-end migration with a real PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Collect feedback on improved prompts and refine as needed
- [ ] Write unit tests for the migration and verification scripts
- [ ] Create a demo video or tutorial showing the improved prompts in action
- [ ] Develop analytics for prompt usage and effectiveness

## Known Issues

- The verification script depends on the `searchPromptsByContent` method, which is optional in the `PromptStorage` interface. Fixed with a runtime check.
- Local testing requires PostgreSQL with the PGAI extension installed.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize testing with a production-like database environment
2. Deploy the improved prompts to production
3. Monitor usage and collect feedback
4. Iterate on prompt quality based on user feedback
5. Consider adding more specialized prompts for specific domains
