# MCP Prompts Server - Project Status

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implemented simplified architecture following SOLID principles:
  - Created unified core types in a single file (`src/core/types.ts`)
  - Implemented focused storage adapters (`src/adapters/file-adapter.ts`)
  - Created streamlined prompt service (`src/services/prompt-service.ts`)
  - Simplified configuration management (`src/config.ts`)
  - Streamlined MCP server implementation with tools (`src/index.ts`)

- [x] Streamlined the file system structure:
  - `src/adapters/` - Storage adapters for persistence
  - `src/core/` - Core types and utilities
  - `src/services/` - Business logic services

- [x] Implemented core MCP tools:
  - `add_prompt` - Add a new prompt
  - `get_prompt` - Get a prompt by ID
  - `update_prompt` - Update an existing prompt
  - `list_prompts` - List prompts with filtering
  - `apply_template` - Apply a template with variables
  - `delete_prompt` - Delete a prompt

- [x] Added Docker support:
  - Created Dockerfile for production
  - Created Dockerfile.dev for development
  - Added docker-compose.yml for basic setup
  - Added docker-compose.full.yml for extended MCP integration

- [x] Updated documentation:
  - Updated README.md with simplified architecture
  - Updated USAGE.md with new tool formats
  - Updated INSTALL.md with new installation options
  - Updated all documentation in docs/ directory

## In Progress

- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Additional storage adapters (PostgreSQL, memory)
- [ ] Enhanced documentation with JSDoc comments

## Planned Features

- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Simple web interface for prompt management
- [ ] Import/export functionality for prompt collections
- [ ] Integration with external LLM providers

## Current Status

The project has been successfully refactored to use a simplified architecture following SOLID principles. The codebase is now more maintainable, extensible, and easier to understand. The core functionality is working as expected, with a clean separation of concerns between the storage layer, business logic, and MCP tool implementations.

## Next Release

The next release will focus on:

1. Adding comprehensive test coverage
2. Implementing PostgreSQL storage adapter
3. Adding more examples and documentation
4. Setting up CI/CD pipeline
