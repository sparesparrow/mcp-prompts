# MCP Prompts Server - Project Status

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implemented simplified architecture following SOLID principles:
  - Created unified core types in a single file (`src/core/types.ts`)
  - Implemented focused storage adapters (`src/adapters/file-adapter.ts`)
  - Created streamlined prompt service (`src/services/prompt-service.ts`)
  - Simplified configuration management (`src/config.ts`)
  - Streamlined MCP server implementation with tools (`src/index.ts`)

- [x] Streamlined the file system structure:
  - `src/adapters/` - Storage adapters for persistence
  - `src/core/` - Core types and utilities
  - `src/services/` - Business logic services

- [x] Implemented core MCP tools:
  - `add_prompt` - Add a new prompt
  - `get_prompt` - Get a prompt by ID
  - `update_prompt` - Update an existing prompt
  - `list_prompts` - List prompts with filtering
  - `apply_template` - Apply a template with variables
  - `delete_prompt` - Delete a prompt

- [x] Added Docker support:
  - Created Dockerfile for production
  - Created Dockerfile.dev for development
  - Added docker-compose.yml for basic setup
  - Added docker-compose.full.yml for extended MCP integration

- [x] Updated documentation:
  - Updated README.md with simplified architecture
  - Added troubleshooting section with fallback mode information
  - Added comprehensive project status and release checklist
  - Organized Docker-related docs in docker/ directory

- [x] Added SDK compatibility features:
  - Implemented fallback mode for MCP SDK compatibility issues
  - Added automatic ESM module fixes for Node.js compatibility
  - Fixed integration tests to work with fallback mode

## In Progress

- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [x] Additional storage adapters (PostgreSQL, file)
- [ ] Memory storage adapter
- [ ] Enhanced documentation with JSDoc comments

## Planned Features

- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Simple web interface for prompt management
- [ ] Import/export functionality for prompt collections
- [ ] Integration with external LLM providers

## Current Status

The project has been successfully refactored to use a simplified architecture following SOLID principles. The codebase is now more maintainable, extensible, and easier to understand. Core functionality is working as expected, with clean separation of concerns between the storage layer, business logic, and MCP tool implementations.

Recent improvements include SDK compatibility features with an automatic fallback mode that enables the server to work even when there are SDK version mismatches or missing functionality. Integration tests have been updated to support this fallback mode as well.

## Next Release

The next release will focus on:

1. Expanding test coverage for core components
2. Implementing a memory storage adapter
3. Adding more examples and comprehensive documentation
4. Setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline
5. Enhancing error handling and logging
