# MCP Prompts Server - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully refactored the MCP Prompts Server with a simplified architecture that follows SOLID principles. The redesign focuses on core functionality, maintainability, and extensibility while reducing complexity.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Simplified Architecture

The refactoring has streamlined the codebase:

- **Core Types**: Unified type definitions in a single file
- **Focused Adapters**: Simple, extensible storage adapters
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion
- **Clean Services**: Business logic separated from storage and presentation
- **MCP Integration**: Direct integration with the Model Context Protocol

### 2. Core Features

The server provides the essential prompt management features:

- Add, update, get, list, and delete prompts
- Support for template variables and substitution
- Category and tag organization
- Filtering and search capabilities

### 3. Developer Experience

The refactoring has significantly improved the developer experience:

- Reduced file count and complexity
- Clear separation of concerns
- Focused, reusable components
- Consistent error handling
- Type safety throughout

### 4. Docker Integration

We've provided simple Docker configurations:

- Basic Docker Compose setup for the prompt server
- Extended configuration for integration with other MCP servers
- Environment variable configuration

## Documentation Updates

The documentation has been updated to reflect the new architecture:

- Updated installation instructions
- Simplified usage guides
- Streamlined API documentation
- Clear examples of MCP tool usage

## Next Steps

Upcoming improvements planned:

1. Add comprehensive testing
2. Implement additional storage adapters
3. Enhance documentation with more examples
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The refactored MCP Prompts Server provides a solid foundation for prompt management with a simplified, maintainable architecture. The focus on SOLID principles ensures the codebase will be easy to extend and maintain in the future.
