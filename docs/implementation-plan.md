# MCP Improved Prompts Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating high-quality improved prompts into the MCP Prompts Server and ensuring seamless operation with the PGAI database.

## Overview

The MCP Prompts Server has been enhanced with integration to the PGAI database, which provides semantic search capabilities and improved prompt organization. This plan details the steps to implement and validate these enhancements.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. PostgreSQL with PGAI Setup

- Install PostgreSQL and create a dedicated database
- Install the necessary extensions (vector, pgai)
- Configure the database for optimal performance with embeddings
- Verify the database connection

See detailed instructions in `docs/pgai-setup.md`

### 2. Improved Prompts Migration

We've created a set of high-quality professional prompts across various categories. These prompts are migrated using the following tools:

- `scripts/migrate-prompts.ts` - Main migration script for improved prompts
- Configuration via `config/pgai.json` for database connection details
- Verification script `scripts/verify-improved-prompts.ts` to ensure successful migration

### 3. Prompt Categories

Our improved prompts are organized into the following categories:

- **Development**: Code review, refactoring, and debugging
- **Architecture/Design**: System design and architecture
- **Analysis**: Data and content analysis
- **Research**: Research assistance and topic modeling
- **Language/Translation**: Contextual translation
- **Planning**: Strategic foresight planning
- **Productivity**: Question generation and follow-up

### 4. Development Workflow

1. Setup the PostgreSQL database with PGAI extension
2. Run the migration script to populate the database
3. Verify the migration using the verification script
4. Start the MCP Prompts Server with PGAI configuration
5. Test the semantic search functionality

```bash
# Example workflow
npm run install:deps            # Install required dependencies
npm run pgai:migrate:improved   # Migrate improved prompts to PGAI
npm run pgai:verify             # Verify prompt migration
npm start                       # Start the server with PGAI config
```

### 5. Testing and Validation

- Verify that all improved prompts are available in the database
- Test semantic search functionality with various queries
- Ensure proper categorization and tagging of prompts
- Validate that the server correctly handles prompt retrieval and search

## Integration with Existing Systems

The MCP Prompts Server with PGAI integration maintains backward compatibility with existing file-based storage while adding powerful new capabilities:

- Enhanced semantic search for finding relevant prompts
- Better organization through tags and categories
- Improved performance for large prompt collections
- Support for embeddings and vector similarity search

## Future Enhancements

- Add more specialized prompts for specific domains
- Implement role-based access control for prompts
- Add analytics for prompt usage and effectiveness
- Support for multilingual prompt collections
