# ADR-001: Project Rationale and Architecture Decision

## Status

**Accepted** - 2025-01-27

## Context

The MCP Prompts Server project needed a clear architectural direction to meet the expectations outlined at [MCPHub](https://mcphub.com/mcp-servers/sparesparrow/mcp-prompts) and [Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@sparesparrow/mcp-prompts). The existing codebase showed signs of architectural complexity and needed consolidation.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports & Adapters) pattern for the MCP Prompts Server, with the following key decisions:

### 1. **Architecture Pattern: Hexagonal Architecture**
- **Rationale**: Provides clean separation of concerns, testability, and extensibility
- **Benefits**: 
  - Isolated domain logic
  - Easy to add new adapters
  - Testable without external dependencies
  - Clear interface boundaries

### 2. **Core Domain Structure**
```
packages/core/
├── entities/           # Domain entities (Prompt, Template, Category, User)
├── value-objects/      # Immutable value objects (PromptId, Tag, TemplateVariable)
├── ports/             # Interface definitions (IPromptRepository, ITemplatingEngine)
├── use-cases/         # Business logic (addPrompt, getPrompt, validatePrompt)
├── schemas/           # Zod validation schemas
├── errors/            # Custom error classes
└── config/            # Configuration management
```

### 3. **Value Objects Implementation**
- **PromptId**: UUID v7 with validation and generation methods
- **Tag**: Regex-validated tags with sanitization
- **TemplateVariable**: Immutable template variable representation

### 4. **Ports and Adapters**
- **Primary Ports**: `IPromptApplication` for driving adapters
- **Secondary Ports**: `IPromptRepository`, `ITemplatingEngine`, etc.
- **Adapters**: File, PostgreSQL, Memory, MDC storage implementations

### 5. **Validation Strategy**
- **Zod Schemas**: Runtime validation for all inputs
- **Business Rules**: Domain-specific validation logic
- **Security Validation**: Content sanitization and security checks

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain
2. **Testability**: Domain logic can be tested in isolation
3. **Extensibility**: New storage backends or templating engines can be added easily
4. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript types with Zod validation
5. **Documentation**: Clear architecture that's easy to understand and document

### Negative Consequences

1. **Complexity**: Initial setup requires more boilerplate code
2. **Learning Curve**: Team members need to understand hexagonal architecture
3. **Performance**: Additional abstraction layers may add minimal overhead

### Risks and Mitigation

1. **Over-engineering Risk**
   - **Risk**: Creating unnecessary abstractions
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on user value, keep interfaces simple

2. **Performance Risk**
   - **Risk**: Abstraction layers affecting performance
   - **Mitigation**: Profile and optimize critical paths

3. **Team Adoption Risk**
   - **Risk**: Team resistance to new architecture
   - **Mitigation**: Provide training and clear examples

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Domain (Week 1-2)
- [x] Create domain entities (Prompt, TemplateVariable, Category, User)
- [x] Implement value objects (PromptId, Tag, TemplateVariable)
- [x] Define port interfaces
- [x] Implement use cases

### Phase 2: Adapters (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement file storage adapter
- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL adapter
- [ ] Implement memory adapter
- [ ] Implement MDC adapter

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 5-6)
- [ ] MCP protocol adapter
- [ ] REST API adapter
- [ ] CLI adapter
- [ ] Integration testing

### Phase 4: Production (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Production deployment

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. **Monolithic Architecture**
- **Pros**: Simpler initial implementation
- **Cons**: Harder to test, maintain, and extend
- **Decision**: Rejected due to long-term maintainability concerns

### 2. **Layered Architecture**
- **Pros**: Familiar pattern for most developers
- **Cons**: Tight coupling between layers
- **Decision**: Rejected in favor of hexagonal architecture

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Pros**: Loose coupling, scalability
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, harder to debug
- **Decision**: Rejected as overkill for current requirements

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Build Time**: <5 minutes for full build
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for core packages
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript strict mode compliance
- **Performance**: <100ms response time for basic operations

### Development Metrics
- **Time to First Contribution**: <30 minutes from git clone
- **CI/CD Pipeline Duration**: <10 minutes
- **Documentation Completeness**: 100% API coverage

### Quality Metrics
- **Zero Critical Security Vulnerabilities**
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: 100%
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Linux, macOS, Windows
