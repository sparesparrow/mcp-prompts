# Developer Guide

This guide helps you contribute to MCP-Prompts, extend its features, and understand its architecture.

> **MCP-Prompts** is built with hexagonal architecture: core logic is isolated from adapters and transports, making it easy to add new storage, APIs, or integrations. See [Overview](00-overview.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution workflow.

Until this guide is complete, see:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – contribution workflow & coding standards.
- `tests/` – examples for unit & integration tests.
- `scripts/` – helper scripts for building, testing, releasing.

## GitHub Actions Workflows Summary

MCP-Prompts uses a set of GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, testing, publishing, and automation. Below is a summary of each workflow:

> See [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more on workflow syntax, triggers, and best practices.

Reusable workflows are not currently used, but can be added for further DRY automation ([see docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows)).
